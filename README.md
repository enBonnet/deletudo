# Deletudo

> The ultimate way to Marie Kondo your inbox conversations! 🧹✨

## What is this?
Deletudo is your friendly inbox declutterer. If your conversations are piling up like dirty laundry, Deletudo is here to help you say goodbye to them with style (and maybe a giggle).

## How does it work?
1. **Open your inbox** (yep, just like you always do).
2. **Select your conversation** (the one you want to vanish).
3. **Start Deletudo** and watch the magic happen!

That’s it. No complicated steps, no PhD required. Just open, select, and start Deletudo!

## Pro Tip: Split View FTW!
Deletudo works best when you use a vertical or horizontal split. Why? Because it likes to stretch out, relax, and show you all the buttons without cramping its style. Give it some space—like a cat on a sunny windowsill.

## Questions? Suggestions? 
Open an issue or send us a meme. We love both.
